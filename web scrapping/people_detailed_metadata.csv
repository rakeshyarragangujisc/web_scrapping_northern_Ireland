OCCUPANCY_RATING_ROOMS_AGG6_PERS,Household: Rooms (Occupancy Rating),"Identifies whether a person lives in a household by the occupancy rating, this provides a measure of whether a household's accommodation is overcrowded, ideally occupied or under occupied. The ages of the household members and their relationships to each other are used to derive the number of rooms they require, based on a standard formula. The number of rooms required is subtracted from the number of rooms in the household's accommodation to obtain the occupancy rating. An occupancy rating of -1 implies that a household has one fewer room than required, 0 suggests that a household's accommodation has an ideal number of rooms, and +1 implies that they have one more room than the standard requirement. This variable applies to all people living in households. As such, this variable reports 'No code required' for the subset of the population living in communal establishments. The number of rooms data are modelled using information from the Land & Property Services Domestic Property List and other sources. Census 2021 did not ask a 'Number of rooms' question. There are definitional differences between Census 2011 and the modelled count produced for Census 2021.

TTWA2011,Travel to Work Areas 2011,"These 10 Travel to Work Areas (TTWAs) were defined in 2011 to approximate labour market areas. They were derived to reflect self-contained areas in which people both work and live, using the main criterion that 75% of their resident, economically active population worked within the same area. This geography has been approximated by aggregating the Census 2021 Data Zones.
